Purpose: To identify the practice and physician characteristics that influence the use of e-scripts after adoption. Methods: Data were obtained from 27 primary care medical group practices that had e-script technology for 2 years. Physician and practice characteristics were obtained from the clinics, and the proportion of each physician's prescriptions sent electronically was calculated from the prescription records. Practice culture data were obtained from a survey of the physicians in each practice. Data were analyzed using hierarchal regression. Findings: Practice-level variables explain most of the variance in the use of e-scripts by physicians, although there are significant differences in use among specialties as well. General internists have slightly lower use rates and pediatricians have the highest rates. Larger practices and multispecialty practices have higher use rates, and five practice culture dimensions influence these rates; two have a negative influence and three (organizational trust, adaptive, and a business orientation) have a positive influence. Practice Implications: While previous studies have identified physician characteristics and product deficiencies as factors limiting the use of electronic information technologies in medical practices, our data indicate that the influence of these factors may be highly dependent on the culture of the practice. Consequently, practice administrators can improve physician acceptance and use of these technologies by making sure that there is a culture/technology fit before deciding on a product.",Electronic prescriptions; Information technologies; Medical group practices,2-s2.0-55549083869

The predominant approach for dental clinicians (DCs) to gather patients' medical history is through patient-reported medical histories and medical consults. However, studies reported varied concordance and reliability of patient-reported medical conditions and medication histories compared to the patient medical records and this process also places a significant burden on patients. Information technology tools/platforms such as an integrated electronic health record containing an electronic dental record module may address these issues. However, these integrated systems are expensive and technically complex and may not be easily adopted by DCs in solo and small group practice who provide the most dental care. The recent expansion of regional healthcare information exchange (HIE) provides another approach, but to date, studies on connecting DCs with HIE are very limited. Our study objectives were to model different aspects of the current approaches to identify the strengths and weaknesses, and then model the HIE approach that addresses the weaknesses and retain the strengths of current approaches. The models of current approaches identified the people, resources, organizational aspects, workflow, and areas for improvement; while models of the HIE approach identified system requirements, functions, and processes that may be shared with software developers and other stakeholders for future development. Methods: There are three phases in this study. In Phase 1, we retrieved peer-reviewed PubMed indexed manuscripts published between January 2013 and November 2020 and extracted modeling related data from selected manuscripts. In Phase 2, we built models for the current approaches by using the Integrated DEFinition Method 0 function modeling method (IDEF0), the Unified Modeling Language (UML) Use Case Diagram, and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) methods. In Phase 3, we created three conceptual models for the HIE approach. Results: From the 47 manuscripts identified, three themes emerged: 1) medical consult process following patient-reported medical history, 2) integrated electronic dental record-electronic health record (EDR-EHR), and 3) HIE. Three models were built for each of the three themes. The use case diagrams described the actions of the dental patients, DCs, medical providers and the use of information systems (EDR-EHR/HIE). The IDEF0 models presented the major functions involved. The BPMN models depicted the detailed steps of the process and showed how the patient's medical history information flowed through different steps. The strengths and weaknesses revealed by the models of the three approaches were also compared. Conclusions: We successfully modeled the DCs' current approaches of accessing patient medical history and designed an HIE approach that addressed the current approaches' weaknesses as well as leveraged their strengths. Organizational management and end-users can use this information to decide the optimum approach to integrate dental and medical care. The illustrated models are comprehensive and can also be adopted by EHR and EDR vendors to develop a connection between dental systems and HIEs.

Established, specialized software for this task is being increasingly replaced by “Operating Room (OR)-modules” appended to enterprise-wide resource planning (ERP) systems. As a result, usability problems are re-emerging and require developers’ attention. Objective: Systematic evaluation of the functionality and social repercussions of a global, marketleading IT business control system (SAP R3, Germany), adapted for real-time OR process steering. Methods: Field study involving document analyses, interviews, and a 73-item survey addressed to 77 qualified (> 1-year system experience) senior planning executives (end users; “planners”) working in surgical departments of university hospitals. Results: Planners reported that 57% of electronic operation requests contained contradictory information. Key screens contained clinically irrelevant areas (36 +/- 29%). Compared to the legacy system, users reported either no improvements or worse performance, in regard to co-ordination of OR stakeholders, intra-day program changes, and safety. Planners concluded that the ERP-planning module was “non-intuitive” (66%), increased planning work (56%, p=0.002), and did not impact upon either organizational mishap spectrum or frequency. Interviews evidenced intra-institutional power shifts due to increased system complexity. Planners resented e.g. a trend towards increased personal culpability for mishap. Conclusions: Highly complex enterprise system extensions may not be directly suited to specific process steering tasks in a high risk/low error-environment like the OR. In view of surgeons’ high primary task load, the repeated call for simpler IT is an imperative for ERP extensions. System design should consider a) that current OR IT suffers from an input limitation regarding planning-relevant real-time data, and b) that there are social processes that strongly affect planning and particularly ERP use beyond algorithms. Real improvement of clinical IT tools requires their independent evaluation according to standards developed for pharmaceutical subjects. © Schattauer 2017.",Enterprise systems; Operation room list; Process steering software; Surgery; User interface,2-s2.0-85019854108

Often referred to as the productivity paradox, increased IT investments have not been consistently associated with increased productivity. Understanding individual IT factors that directly contribute to business value should provide insight into the productivity paradox. PURPOSE: The effects of 3 different firm-level IT characteristics on financial performance in the health care industry are studied. Specifically, the effects of IT budget, IT outsourcing, and the relative number of IT personnel on firm-level financial performance are analyzed. METHODS: Regression analysis of archival survey data for 914 Integrated Healthcare Delivery Systems is performed. RESULTS: IT budgetary expenditures and the number of IT services outsourced are associated with increases in the profitability of Integrated Healthcare Delivery Systems, whereas increases in IT personnel are not significantly associated with increased profitability. Each one tenth of a percentage increase in IT expenditures is associated with approximately $100,000 in increased profit, and each additional IT service outsourced is associated with approximately $950,000 in increased profit for an average-sized Integrated Healthcare Delivery System. IMPLICATIONS: To increase profitability, IT administrators should increase IT budgetary expenditures along with IT outsourcing levels. IT administrators in the health care industry can use such findings during budgeting cycles to justify increased investments in IT personnel as being budget neutral while increasing organizational capacity. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Health care; IT outsourcing; IT payoff; Outsourcing; Productivity; Return on investment,2-s2.0-37349001996

How do they want to use these phones in their businesses? How do their use and attitudes compare with those of graduate students at a Midwestern US university? For the second phase of this project: Can a cell-phone delivered information system be designed for artisanal miners and small farmers in Katanga Province to share local pricing information for copper, cobalt, and maize?; Situating the case: Researchers in participatory design for social and/or technological change have traditionally assumed that including users in early design phases will result in democratization of project outcomes. When these participatory design projects are situated in intercultural settings, however, they are complicated by political and economic conditions, as well as differences in values and social relations. Because participatory design relies on dialogue within robust, multimodal communication networks, weaknesses in this approach arise when trusted social relations are not in place upon which to build these multimodal communication networks. Cases of participatory design between colleagues in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate profound effects of political and economic inequities on participatory design projects.; Conclusions: Despite the need to abandon the project, this case raised these questions about participatory design for information and communication technologies (ICT) projects when collaborators do not 'speak the same language:' How can communication researchers effectively build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations in order to facilitate successful participatory design projects? Given the research obligations and reward structures at US universities, is it feasible for communication researchers to spend the time to build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations, which may not yield publishable research or quantifiable results for three years or more? Given the political and social conditions in many developing areas, can communication researchers rely on the stable conditions and personal relations that are necessary to conduct participatory design for ICT projects? © 1988-2012 IEEE.; Methodology: This is an experience report of a project that developed initially from a classroom project in which my students in the US conducted a communication audit for a partner based in Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A US-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) arranged the partnership and I later went to the field to carry out this project.; About the case: Working with an NGO while based exclusively in the US, we attempted to develop a system from which people working in rural areas could share business information, such as reporting business conditions in a rural location back to the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters 75 km away, via mobile phones. The project did not work because people in Katanga were not familiar with the information design issues involved in the system and I was not familiar with the actual business situation at the NGO in Katanga. To address these issues, I traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and interviewed NGO staff and clients. But my presence in the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters created irreparable social disruption. I continued the project with a new client in Katanga and revised goals for the information-sharing system, but that system, too, did not work for lack of a trusted social network of informants to participate in the information-sharing system. In the end, I was only able to complete an initial analysis of the needs.",Information and communication technologies (ICTs); Intercultural design; Mobile phones; Participatory design; Sub-Saharan Africa,2-s2.0-84907501296

Specifically, it explores a case of business process outsourcing (BPO), which is the transfer of a number of business processes, such as payroll, supply chain management, and customer relations to an external supplier. In this case, a company based in the US outsourced its business processes to a company in India. Research questions: (1) If widespread proficiency in English is the reason for India's predominant position in outsourcing, then why do we hear about communication problems? (2) What are the causes of such problems? (3) In what forms and situations do they manifest? (4) How could technical communication offer solutions to ameliorate or minimize some of these communication problems? Situating the case: Similar cases studied include previous studies of call centers in the Philippines and outsourcing relationships in software companies have identified challenges in those relationships to problems of intercultural communications, such as language use and differences in culture. Three areas of inquiry informed this study. Intercultural communication theories provide frameworks and touch points for assessing the role of culture in communication. Previous studies of outsourcing and offshoring provided definitions of the broad range of arrangements that comprise outsourcing. Although these studies all concluded that communication is a crucial factor in the success of outsourced projects, they offered few details of communication problems, their causes, manifestations, and possible solutions. Accounts of India represent India as a rapidly-growing, dynamic economy with certain typical communication problems. Methodology: The study was designed as a mixed-methods, single-case study with a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were gathered through surveys that helped develop a picture of patterns in areas such as communication problems, preferred methods of communication, and patterns of escalation while qualitative data from 45 personal interviews and one group interview provided insights into the nature and resolution of communication dissonances. About the case: The case studied ABC Corporation, a captive Indian company that performed BPO for a major American corporation. Communication problems that arise in the outsourcing relationship include differences in corporate culture and differences in linguistic and rhetorical choices. Issues causing these problems include differences in education and training. Conclusions: Ongoing training in cross-cultural communication is needed at all stages of the outsourcing cycle, with an emphasis on communication skills in the early stages of the process, especially the hiring stage. Technical communication can offer solutions to these problems because our field can help structure suitable training applying theories such as Cross' Theory of centripetal and centrifugal forces, which provide frameworks for assessing and addressing communication problems. © 2012 IEEE.",Business process outsourcing (BPO); centripetal and centrifugal forces; India; intercultural communication; outsourcing,2-s2.0-84865505921

The paper aims to extend the discrete model used by classical system engineering (SE) for a wisdom, knowledge, information, data, and measurement (WKIDM) pyramid to add a wrapper of emergent intelligence to support successful decision making and implementation. Design/methodology/approach - Building on previous theoretical complex venture work, this research explores the value of extending the WKIDM or ""Knowledge Pyramid"" model proposed by classical SE and KM approaches. The resultant IWKIDM model builds on the insights derived from chaos and complexity theories; KM research; observations of several acquisition successes and failures; and doctoral research on agile enterprise decision support. Findings - The paper finds that successful classical SE complicated systems models built with the closed system assumptions of linearity, predictability, and context independence do not scale to the needed open system Intelligence Age solutions. It is necessary to build on a Complex Venture model that guides the engineering solutions that: leverage emergent behavior insights to develop an improved intelligence model for the interaction of complex venture intellectual capital (i.e., self-organizing agents) with the WKIDM pyramid entities and the intelligence products consumer context; and examine WKIDM pyramid levels of abstraction for detachable and complex representations (e.g., explicit versus tacit knowledge).

Although there are a large number of modelling techniques to aid BP and IS design, there is little indication of which techniques can be suitable to model their integration. This research suggests a simulation model that can be used to depict BP/IS integration. Design/methodology/approach - The simulation framework proposed in this paper is based on a simulation framework used previously. For both frameworks, a single case study approach is employed for theory building and testing. The results provided by the application of the ASSESS-IT framework (theory testing) are used to propose the new ISBPS framework (theory building), which is tested again in the case study. Findings - The models derived from the ISBPS framework provide quantifiable metrics of the integration of BP and IS. These data can help analysts to foresee the benefits that the insertion of a given IS design may bring to the organisational processes. Research limitations/implications - The development of the ISBPS models proved to be complex. Further research should focus on testing the ISBPS framework with more complex IS and to provide mechanisms to facilitate their design. Practical implications - IS practitioners may consider simulation to evaluate IS design strategies. Originality/value - The ISBPS simulation model provides quantifiable metrics of the integration of a given IS design within a given BP scenario.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential barriers to their success in influencing cost and quality. Design/methodology/approach - The health care supply chain (SC) is analyzed and five national health initiatives attempting to apply CPC techniques are described. Findings - Five national-level programs designed to improve health care quality and control costs use a variety of CPC techniques to create incentives and/or disincentives to influence suppliers' behavior. Six barriers to success are identified that threaten healthcare CPC initiatives. They include: widespread resistance to change; information system limitations; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the required time investment; lack of commitment to CPC principles; and the sustainability of the CPC business model. Research implications/limitations - Investigation into the barriers to success is warranted to develop evidence-based solutions to improve effectiveness of CPC approaches in health care.

This paper seeks to explore this behavior using the resource-based view. Design/methodology/approach - The case of an information technology (IT) unit of a multinational manufacturing firm is presented to provide insight into the issues involved when adopting and migrating an IT resource system to a shared services model. The analysis is extended using conceptual models of the relevant sub-systems developed through the soft systems methodology (SSM), using a set of root level definitions that are intended to express the transformation to a shared services model. Findings - The results suggest that the major changes involved when transitioning to shared services are process and communication related. Aligning the team members and gaining their commitment are necessary for success. Practical implications - The case analysis and SSM models provide some insight into the important issues to be considered when moving to a shared services model. Originality/value - With the growing practice of shared services, it is important to understand how a shared services model fits successfully into the overall business strategy of the firm. This study will spawn further research into the evaluation and control techniques for the different types of IT capabilities under a shared services model. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Case studies; Information technology-led strategy; Resource management,2-s2.0-33947104124

Many theorists now advocate that effective security policies should be created at senior management level. This is because executives are able to evaluate the organisation using a holistic approach as well as having the power to ensure that new systems and procedures are implemented in a timely manner. There is, however, a continuing lack of understanding regarding the strategic importance of managing information security. In addition, there is a gap in the literature on the relationship between directors and information security strategy. This paper attempts to close this gap by exploring how directors perceive their organisation's security and what factors influence their decisions on the development and implementation of information security strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on constructivist grounded theory. Forty-three interviews were conducted at executive level in 29 organisations. These interviews were then coded and analysed in order to develop new theory on directors' perception of risk and its effect on the development and implementation of information security strategy. Findings - The analysis shows that senior managers' engagement with information security is dependent on two key variables: the strategic importance of information systems to their organisation and their perception of risk. Additionally, this research found that these two variables are affected by both organisational contextual factors and the strategic and operational actions undertaken within the business. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the two board variables also have an impact on the organisation's environment as well as its strategic and operational actions. This paper uses the data gathered from the interviews to develop a model of these factors. In addition, a perception grid is constructed which illustrates the potential concerns that can drive board engagement. Practical implications - The paper illustrates the advantages of using the perception grid to understand and develop current and future information security issues. Originality/value - The paper investigates how organisational directors perceive information security and how this perception influences the development of their information security strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Boards; Data security; Governance; Information control; Perception,2-s2.0-35348859021

An e-enterprise security management life cycle (eSMLC) is then proposed to ensure the unification and congruity of e-enterprise security management. Design/methodology/approach - To demonstrate the practicality of the eSMLC, a case study is presented to depict the application and implementation of the methodology at a leading US heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning manufacturing company. Findings - The case study substantiates that the eSMLC methodology can be employed as a unified mechanism to provide central, cohesive control and global visibility. It helps security professionals in the company develop practical steps and sustainable solutions for tackling the unique security challenges arising in an open, unbounded e-enterprise environment. Practical implications - Implementing eSMLC can help the security specialists focus on different critical security management jobs in a sequential but interrelated and logical manner. Through the use of eSMLC, in-depth understanding of the potential environmental risks can be properly acquired. The methodology also helps managers perform a proactive analysis of the consequences of security breaches in relation to risks. Originality/value - The proposed eSMLC methodology provides a viable foundation for building a secure and manageable computing environment using a recommended set of solutions, processes, procedures, and technologies. eSMLC methodology renders a unified, structured framework which helps develop an actual security plan and solutions and/or improve currently used security standards, practices, and configurations in response to special security requirements and long-term e-business needs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Data security; Electronic commerce; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-18144386883

Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 100 IT personnel from Australia completed a questionnaire, which contained measures for adjustment, affect state, and coping strategies. The use of hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that specific individual characteristics influenced the psychological adjustment of the IT personnel sampled. Findings - IT personnel who engaged in a more problem-focused style of coping, such as active coping were found to be better adjusted than those who engaged in a more emotion-focused styles of coping, such as cognitive-avoidance coping, social coping, accepting responsibility, and self-controlling coping. Serendipitously, the research revealed that increased depression of IT personnel was associated with positive affect.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how PHM can support effective execution of some PSS contracts and to set out the future research agenda for the development of an online simulation modelling framework that will further harness the interaction between PHM and PSS. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology commenced by collating facts and figures from the existing body of knowledge, from which a set of key findings is presented from both technical and business perspectives. Analysis of the key findings highlights the current state of PHM-PSS interaction, the capability of existing tools and techniques and a comprehensive analysis of PSS performances, with and without PHM. Findings - Increased demand for total asset performance from the customers has been the main driver for PSS providers to adopt PHM technology. In the case of high value assets, PHM is used to capture the condition of the assets and to feed this information back to the PSS operations management which, in turn, will be used to plan a maintenance regime, spare parts provision, as well as to mitigate the dynamic behaviour which commonly occurs in PSS. Simulation modelling, driven by asset health condition, shows a considerable potential as an effective tool to control the execution of the PSS contract. In addition to the benefits from the maintenance services, the PHM-PSS interaction can increase the controllability of the PSS contract execution and allow future modifications to PSS contracts. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in the comprehensive analysis of the interaction between PHM and PSS, especially focusing on the interaction during the PSS contract execution.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use workshop and survey data on the role of the developer/builder to further develop the domain-specific commercialization model for residential construction products. The authors propose a cross-functional system to better facilitate innovation. Findings - Successful concurrent commercialization requires risk sharing among all members of a product's supply chain. The authors advocate concurrent management in commercialization, which requires information sharing and knowledge transfer among supply-chain members early in a commercialization project and a special form of concurrent engineering for construction products, which is called concurrent commercialization (CC). Practical implications - The research indicates that addressing the developer/builder risk along the entire supply chain is one key determinant to a successful commercialization project. It also indicates that commercialization involves more than just technical product design; commercialization cuts across all functional areas. Originality/value - The research data, along with the review of the literature on product innovation and commercialization, lead one to advocate concurrent engineering for construction products termed concurrent commercialization (CC). Since the research clearly indicates that the developer/builder is the most reluctant customer in the supply chain, CC applied to construction products emphasizes the influence of mitigating developer/builder risks in the design of a commercialization project. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Building services; Construction industry; Product innovation; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-58849119159

The classification scheme, in the form of a matrix, identifies, organizes, and defines tools of the six sigma problem-solving process as taught and implemented at a large manufacturing company. Design/methodology/approach - Development of a problem-solving matrix to enable more efficient and effective use of tools applied to a six sigma project in a large manufacturing company. Findings - The application of the methodology to a case study in a large manufacturing company related to an Air Conditioning (A/C) No Fill concern. The exercise of applying the six sigma tools matrix to this project would have been improved if conducted at the beginning of the six sigma Belt training and start of the A/C No Fill project. Research limitations/implications - Since, the matrix was not fully completed at the start of either the training or the project, the team was unable to begin using the developed matrix until midway through both. This posed some limitations in judging the efficiency and effectiveness of the matrix. Although it is believed that both were improved, the maximum benefit may not have been achieved because of timing in application. Future application of the matrix should commence at the beginning of the project to enable maximum results for more efficient and effective problem solving and identification of proposed solution. Practical implications - Manufacturing and service organizations can improve their problem-solving methodology by using the approach outlined in this paper. It will enable companies to better ""match"" the tools necessary to solve real-life business problems.

However, there are very few empirical and theoretical studies on the factors that influence performance measurement practices in SMEs. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap using both theoretical and empirical approaches. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review and interviews were used to identify four key contingency factors for PMS in SMEs. A qualitative research design involving a multiple case study methodology was carried out to investigate how these factors influence performance measurement. Findings - The relationship between the contingency factors and performance measurement were formalized in four theoretical propositions. First corporate governance structure is one of the main factors influencing performance measurement adoption and use. Second, advanced information practices and advanced behaviours on the part of the people involved appear to be a necessary condition for the effective implementation and use of PMS in SMEs. Third, a change in a firm's business model seems to lead to the development of an improved PMS. Finally, the successful implementation of a PMS seems to be driven by an authoritative management style. Research limitations/implications - Contingency factors were studied independently. Future research might investigate how these factors collectively influence performance measurement practices to make interdependence more explicit. Practical implications - The theoretical propositions provide useful knowledge for defining a methodology and managerial tool to support performance measurement in SMEs.

In particular; examines the role that the intervention of project management practices (formal project methodologies and outsourcing) play in large and/or complex IS projects, which result in good project performance. Design/methodology/approach - A survey instrument was completed by 449 information systems managers about a specific upgrade project. The primary analytical approach used was structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings - It was found that neither project complexity nor project size are good indicators of meeting a project's target date. Large projects that adopted formal project management practices were more probable to meet the project target date. Projects with a high degree of complexity which involved outsourcing and adopted formal project management practices, were more likely to meet the project target date. Practical implications - Clearly, the message to managers of IS projects is to establish a project methodology, especially in large, enterprise-wide projects, and when some degree of outsourcing is required. Research limitations/implications - Future research should consider additional measures of performance such as cost, end-user satisfaction and business value. Originality/value - Much had been written in the literature about how large, complex IT projects have high failure rates. Our study provides conclusive evidence that, the greater the degree of methodology implementation, the greater the chance for meeting the project's target date.

Practical implications - The model is widely adaptable to different settings as a tool for business enterprises, organizations in different sectors and for use in communities of practice and learning/knowledge settings. Originality/value - This is an area of application where a more standard framework approach to information and knowledge auditing would be beneficial. The structure provides a working basis for further development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communication technologies; Customer satisfaction; Document delivery; Information audit; Information organizations; Knowledge management,2-s2.0-57049101341

Design/methodology/approach - Members of the Institute for Supply Management and the Council of Logistics Management were asked to respond to a survey questionnaire. Factor analysis was used to analyze data from valid responses received from 185 firms. Findings - Factor analysis resulted in three e-procurement success factors (SF):supplier and contract management; end-user behavior and e-procurement business processes; and information and e-procurement infrastructure. Three challenge-to-implementation factors (CIF) also emerged: lack of system integration and standardization issues; immaturity of e-procurement-based market services and end-user resistance; and maverick buying and difficulty in integrating e-commerce with other systems. Research limitations/implications - A representative sampling design should be used in the future to be able to make claims for generalizable results. Practical implications - E-procurement is a very important initiative with significant cost savings potential for firms. This study's findings can guide various stages of corporate implementation efforts. Originality/value - This study fulfills the need for solid empirical findings on this very important topic that has a direct impact on a firm's bottom line. E-procurement is still in the early stages of marketplace deployment and guidance is still needed on how to do it right. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.,Business-to-business marketing; Electronic commerce; Procurement; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-33947106968

Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted to quantify the current situation of CEIS. The population consisted of stakeholders with reliable working knowledge of their firms' information systems. Statistical tests were conducted to draw conclusions from the data. Findings – A total of 48 per cent of the firms use enterprise resource planning packages, but only 4 per cent of these firms chose to implement the project management modules that are commercially available. Only 16 per cent of the respondents were satisfied with their current level of integration due to CEIS. There was no evidence to suggest a tendency for the integration level due to CEIS to increase together with the business geographical dispersion. Research limitations/implications – The rate of response to the survey was low (9 per cent), maybe due to the unavailability of CEIS in all the firms that were contacted. Further, research is needed to study the dynamics between management practices and their effect on CEIS adoption and level of integration. Practical implications – Integration efforts and software that are currently in use still do not fully address the concerns of industry practitioners. Associations found between the level of integration and project characteristics can be used to help IT stakeholders decide on the CEIS functions to adopt. Originality/value – The strategic, operational and organizational benefits found from the implementation of CEIS are based on current data obtained from a targeted survey of construction related firms. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Construction industry; Construction systems; Information systems; Project management; Resource planning,2-s2.0-84986170559

The alignment of the performance indicators with the company's critical operating factors, and the processes having bottle-necks alongside the value chain, could result in a very compact, target-oriented, and quality-based performance measurement system. This paper aims to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The quality-based performance measurement system is developed by integrating the existing performance indicators of an organization with those of best-in-class management practices. The organizational processes included range from business leadership to the operational level. The key performance indicators (KPIs) depict the existing status transparently and comprehensively, whereas later on they can be used to control the processes with the pre-defined values/measures. The KPIs of a process are documented and standardized once they are implemented. An action plan is then developed to write down the prerequisite for the new KPIs and to prioritize the existing ones for the sake of improvement. Findings - It is affirmed that most of the employees had found the performance measurement system a very useful tool to tightly control the flow of their processes. It is very important to mention that this system does not mean giving way to another flood of information; instead it is designed to support the company's decision-making process through target-oriented indicators that could be compared with the existing best practices. Originality/value - The concept described is aimed at developing and implementing a quality-based performance measurement system within an organization. This system is developed through comparing the existing organizational practices with those having been labelled ""Best-in-class"" and it provides an alternative to the Balanced Score Card approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Germany; Performance measurement (quality); Process management; Quality indicators; Vehicle components,2-s2.0-77953559990

This paper presents the organizational, logistic, and technological problems in reengineering established real estate library business processes by considering a real case study, although the identify of the firm is not revealed. Findings - The information management literature is strewn with bits and pieces on document imaging and its perceived benefits through increased technology. The business process is more complex than the sales literature suggests. Imaging projects begin with a paper backlog that requires preparation, organization, taxonomy, and elimination of redundancy through document analysis. Personnel, budget, and administration need to be allocated. Simultaneously, a document management system must be selected, data warehouse space allocated, and a design storyboard constructed. Research limitations/implications - The case study is from the private sector, but there may be other aspects to consider in developing the return on investment argument in other sectors. Practical implications - How will the paper backlog be eliminated forever?

Design/methodology/approach - A review of the literature from approximately 1986 through 2004 served as the basis for analysis and comparison of BI and KM. The theoretical scope of the paper is to distinguish between BI and KM to clarify the role of each in a business environment. Findings - BI focuses on explicit knowledge, but KM encompasses both tacit and explicit knowledge. Both concepts promote learning, decision making, and understanding. Yet, KM can influence the very nature of BI itself. Hence, this paper explains the nature of the integration between BI and KM and makes it clear that BI should be viewed as a subset of KM. Originality/value - This paper establishes a clear distinction between two important fields of study, BI and KM, establishing an expanded role for BI. That is, the role of BI in knowledge improvement. This expanded role also suggests that the effectiveness of a BI will, in the future, be measured based on how well it promotes and enhances knowledge, how well it improves the mental model(s) and understanding of the decision maker(s) and thereby how well it improves their decision making and hence firm performance.

Literature frequently predicts that the application of IT reduces transaction costs. Often, no real explanation is given, and the impact of IT on supply chain management (SCM) is not assessed. Design/methodology/approach - Discussing the application of IT in SCM, a classification of different forms of collaboration (integration) is presented. Building on the essential transaction cost elements of specificity and uncertainty, the (high) costs of transactions in different supply chain integration forms are revealed. Findings - The claim that IT reduces transaction costs is objected to in its general form. The reduction of transaction costs is dependent on the form of supplier integration. Through market transactions (not managed process links) and monitored process links, a reduction of transaction costs by using IT is likely. In the case of managed process links and non-member process links, a reduction of transaction costs is achieved only if certain conditions apply. A conceptual framework is presented, using uncertainty and specificity to explain which IT applications can reduce transaction costs in a supply chain. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on conceptual thought. Beyond this framework for reducing IT-based transaction costs in supply chains empirical research is needed to validate the findings. Practical implications - Companies need to be aware that applying IT in their supply chain is not sake in itself. The classification provided in this paper support-related decision by pointing out that different IT-solutions fit different business process links. Originality/value - The paper presents a more detailed analysis of the impacts IT applications have in SCM.

Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires and some interviews within Lithuanian SMEs helped reveal what the present situation is in terms of KM processes and the use of IT. Findings - There appears to be a strong awareness of KM already. However, the development of adequate methods to make information management (IM) and KM fully effective appears to be lacking or only partially realized.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data from three in-depth case studies are collected. The three case studies are small UK ETO companies, i.e. manufacturing companies that customise generic product types to meet specific customer requirements and only make these to order. Findings - The paper identifies three key barriers: management awareness of the benefits and implementation challenges of these systems, perceived risk to the business and to information security and intensity of skills needed for their successful implementation. The paper proposes an iterative model that aims at overcoming these barriers. Research limitations/implications - The authors apply the knowledge on technology adoption in the context of small ETO companies to explain the apparent lack of implementation of supply chain integration systems by small ETO organisations; and propose a model to overcome these barriers. The main limitation is the lack of full validation of our model. Although this model has been presented and discussed the with case study companies, it has not been fully implemented yet.

Findings The results reveal that the factors influencing SMEs' adoption of enterprise systems are different from the factors influencing SMEs' adoption of other previously studied information systems (IS) innovations. SMEs were found to be more influenced by technological and organisational factors than environmental factors. Moreover, the results indicate that firms with a greater perceived relative advantage, a greater ability to experiment with these systems before adoption, greater top management support, greater organisational readiness and a larger size are predicted to become adopters of enterprise systems. Research limitations/implications Although this study focused on the factors that influence SMEs' adoption of a set of enterprise systems (i.e. ERP, CRM, SCM and eprocurement), it fails to differentiate between factors that influence each of these systems.

The critical review focuses on information systems and business research papers, books, case studies and theoretical articles, etc. Findings - By systematically and critically analysing and synthesising the literature review, the researchers identify and propose a total of 40 ERP post-implementation risks related to diverse operational, analytical, organisation-wide and technical aspects. A risk ontology is subsequently established to highlight these ERP risks, as well as to present their potential causal relationships. Research limitations/implications - For researchers, the established ERP risk ontology represents a starting point for further research, and provides early insights into a research field that will become increasingly important as more and more companies progress from implementation to exploitation of ERPs. Practical implications - For practitioners, the risk ontology is an important tool and checklist to support risk identification, prevention, management and control, as well as to facilitate strategic planning and decision making. Originality/value - There is a scarcity of studies focusing on ERP post-implementation in contrast with an over abundance of studies focusing on system implementation and project management aspects. This paper aims to fill this significant research gap by presenting a risk ontology of ERP post-adoption. It represents a first attempt in producing a comprehensive model in its area. No other such models can be found from the literature review. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Information systems; Manufacturing resource planning; Risk management,2-s2.0-70149108276

Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, the paper investigates an e-procurement scenario involving emergency material purchases where web services provide for real-time response, a dynamic supplier set, and the ability to perform cross-enterprise purchase processes in an inter-operable fashion. The paper proposes engineering reliability models for three network configurations as a basis for quantifying the value of web services, and develops a numerical illustration to both test its usefulness and to derive preliminary insights into supplier network design in this environment. Findings - This research finds that a stand-by model is descriptive of reliability in networks where suppliers are identified and managed using web services, and that this approach quantifies operational improvement in this type of e-procurement system. The research also finds that the benefit derived from using web services for emergency purchases depends on the characteristics of the supply network itself, specifically the failure frequency of the existing suppliers and the time to restore operation after a failure occurs. Originality/value - These findings are important to information system managers when assessing the financial and technical benefits of real-time and dynamic information technologies, as well as supply chain managers seeking to implement a dynamically configured supply network. Future research directions include extensions of the reliability models, data acquisition for specifying their parameter values, and investigation into the usefulness of this approach in hardware decisions of web services applications in business. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Reliability management; Supply chain management; Worldwide web,2-s2.0-33645022424

Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory survey of Millennial business students was conducted to measure their self-reported use and perceived effectiveness of a variety of hardware, traditional, and Web 2.0 tools. Findings - An exploratory study of business students finds that course websites and online assessments are the technological tools they report using most often. The technology tools that business students perceive as most effective include personal computers, laptop computers, course websites, discussion groups, message boards, and online assessments. Research limitations/implications - This exploratory study looked only at business students' self-report use and perceived effectiveness of technology tools. Future research is needed to examine other college students beyond business, to measure actual use and effectiveness, and to incorporate input from faculty on the use and effectiveness of technology tools.

These criteria are applied for the analysis of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)-reports of five major cement manufacturers. This will result in a discussion if GRI-based sustainability reports really contain the information needed for judging corporate sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a literature review of common definitions and principles, the main criteria of corporate sustainability were developed and a set of evaluation criteria for analyzing sustainability reports was proposed. Definitions and principles from concepts such as eco-efficiency, triple-bottom-line, the natural step and stakeholder value were considered. Using these criteria analysis was made of the GRI-based sustainability reports of five major cement manufacturers in order to find out to what extent the reports really address the sustainability performance of the companies. The companies were chosen because of their dominant position in the building material supply chain. The building industry has multiple impacts on the environment as well as on the social system. The decisions and actions of the cement manufacturers have influence on the entire supply chain, from raw material suppliers to the end customer. Findings - The findings lead to the conclusion that the current GRI guidelines are not sufficient to make sustainability reporting for the cement industry relevant and clear. In other words, the guidelines are not sufficient for assuring that a report answers the questions of how sustainable a company is and how quickly it is approaching sustainability. Within the GRI guidelines the needs of the customers are not considered sufficiently. This points at an important area where business excellence ideas can support sustainability reporting. This could be done, for instance, by including the concept of cost of poor quality into sustainability reporting guidelines. Originality/value - The most common framework for sustainability reporting on an empirical basis was critically analysed. The qualitative study delivers insights into sustainability reporting in an industry with large impacts on global climate change and living conditions. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach - The author lists the open source initiative's definition for open source products, licensing information, the value of open source in a global economy, misconceived barriers to open source adoption, a functional comparison of open source and commercial software products, and web sites where open source products may be obtained. Findings - Open source usage is prevalent throughout the world for governmental, business, educational, military, and space exploration purposes. Notwithstanding, some commercial enterprises such as the Microsoft Corporation have viewed the open source movement as a threat to profitability, citing alleged intellectual property infringement violations. However, other commercial entities such as IBM, Oracle, Novell, and Apple computer have embraced open source technology to conduct business operations as well as satisfy customer needs. Public appeal for open source products has been strong enough for Microsoft, through a recent public statement, to disclose that the firm wishes to ""build a bridge"" with the open source community, an apparent realization that open source is here to stay. The knowledge worker should understand that commercial and open source applications may coexist in the same IT environment. Originality/value - A knowledge enterprise's total cost of ownership (TCO) can be significantly reduced through the use of open source software, resulting in an improvement to overall performance attributed to the collaborative and innovative nature of the open source model.

Design/methodology/approach - The most significant barrier to successful implementation of EDRMS is ""culture"" rather than cost. Implicit is a willingness of users to employ EDRM as their method of choice to achieve such an end. Anecdotal evidence and a real case example are shared to explore the approach to developing virtual folders to meet user requirements and organisational needs. Findings - Staffordshire County Council's EDRMS does not employ folders. To save a document, users associate it with a level in the Council's functional business classification scheme (BCS); this is achieved through a series of ""saved searches"". Metadata requirements are embedded within the BCS levels and the user chooses a title and functional association for the record. Practical implications/limitations - This is a way of adopting what exists as standard technology within EDRM systems to satisfy a user need. The vital part is to firstly recognise why the barrier existed in the deployment of a functional classification scheme and further to move beyond the ""face value"" of why the users performed a particular methodology.

Customers, policymakers and business partners increasingly require the monitoring and reporting of the organisational impact on sustainability. However, traditional IS evaluation approaches are not able to capture the impact of information technology (IT)/IS on sustainability, especially in relation to social and environmental dimensions, so the authors want to stimulate discussion and research related to this area. Design/methodology/approach This paper is conceptual. However, it is based on the results of an existing related research project focussed on supply chain evaluation. Findings In order to stimulate discussion and research, the authors propose a framework that was originally developed to evaluate supply chain practices, in which IS often play a major role. The framework is built on three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – which are divided further into three subdimensions. It can be used as a starting point to develop a framework for sustainabilityoriented IS evaluation.

The research focuses on the performance of suppliers who develop a partnering mechanism for procurement of complex manufacturing projects. In total, four supply chain metrics are evaluated: project scope change, ratio of actual-to-estimated project costs, gross profit margin, and delay in deliverable shipments. Hypotheses are formulated to contrast partnerships and arms-length relationships for industrial procurement. Statistical results support the conclusion that supplier performances improve under partnership. Design/methodology/approach - Four supply chain metrics were generated through review of literature and in-depth field study. The authors utilized the supply chain management, project management, and principal-agent theory literature to develop hypotheses to examine effects of instituting a partnership agreement. A case study approach was employed to collect financial and operational data from 167 projects among a manufacturing supplier and a group of customers that purchase industrial analyzer systems. Statistical techniques were employed for hypothesis testing. Findings - The findings from the authors' empirical work support the prediction in partnership literature that suppliers' operational and financial performances improve after they and manufacturing customers jointly implement partnerships. A supplementary finding also suggests that a manufacturer should develop partnering mechanisms with suppliers to achieve higher performance for both the individual firms and the entire supply chain. Research limitations/implications - This study, like other ""before and after"" analyses, encounters limitations on causality. Advanced techniques, e.g. cause-effect investigation with richer data, are hence necessary to validate the causal relationships between performance metrics and their drivers. This study focuses only on the supplier's side of the supply chain and its partnership in a specific industrial setting. Future research may consider studying the joint performance by supplier-customer dyads in commercial partnerships with variations of partnering agreements. Practical implications - Partnerships motivate trading partners to engage in higher level of coordination. Transactional hazards can be reduced and performance may improve under the partnering mechanism. The manufacturer may design the procurement partnership as a collaborative mechanism, thus helping a partnering supplier and itself to obtain increased mutual gains. Originality/value - The paper provides detailed information of a unique case study of the partnership in a project-type supply chain, which is relatively new in the literature. Research streams on supply chain management, project management, and principal-agent theory are integrated to evaluate supplier performance.

Following the analysis of 16 indepth case studies, a set of six high level, fundamental competencies and 17 facilitating competencies are identified. A framework for orchestrating the organizational competencies is also presented. The results of this research would be useful to academics in developing measures for assessing the level of organizational competence and for practitioners in identifying and nurturing competencies for organizational benefits realization. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology involved two phases. Phase 1 entailed conducting 16 extensive case studies. Case study methodology employed follows guidelines provided by Yin and Benbasat et al. Case studies are a suitable means to collect the data since the notion of competencies in delivering IT benefits has not been well understood in the literature. By analyzing and understanding the particular situation and factors in each organization in an indepth manner, the paper develops a sound interpretation of the abilities that organizations need to have in place to deliver IT benefits. Findings – In order to gain business benefits from IT investments, organizations must develop competencies to exploit IT. These competencies involve individual skills and organizational processes that enable those skills to be effectively applied. This paper identifies 23 competencies categorized into fundamental and facilitating competencies that firms need to have in place if IT services are to be delivered adequately and business benefits achieved. Also developed is a network of competences based on the data collected in the 16 cases studied. Research limitations/implications – Like any research, this paper has its limitations. Given the qualitative and interpretive nature of the research, a lot of assertions are interpretations of the authors. While in the literature, this has been argued as a valid way to undertake research, clearly there are biases that creep into the research.

Design/methodology/approach - Multivariate regression models are developed in order to identify the characteristics of determinants of linkages in the supply chain stakeholders (suppliers, internal stakeholders and customers). The survey was administered to individuals identified from a list of US executive officers, directors, presidents, or vice presidents. Among four hundred respondents, 122 were considered as valid from those who practice supply chain management for their business operations. Findings - Internal integration is the most important contributor to cost-containment while integration with the supplier is the best strategy to achieve supply chain reliable performance. Availability of electronic ordering systems for customers is an important strategy in cost-containment. Fast and easy ordering is the best strategy for customer in performance reliability. Reliable delivery with supplier collaboration in managing a broad supply chain operation is the best way to link with suppliers. Access to the inventory information creates the most favorable environment in internal integration. Research limtations/implications - A vigorous multivariate statistical modeling process was employed to seek a possible linkage between the level of integration and the supply chain performances at a different linkage stage.

Design/methodology/approach - Face-to-face interviews were undertaken with 33 Scottish suppliers. Findings - Results indicate that less than a third of the companies surveyed in Scotland had implemented AR/QRI systems and that many supply chain members had not fully understood the benefits of implementing information technology (IT) to support an AR/QRI strategy. They perceive it more as a strategy for retailers than as a virtual supply chain strategy. Research limitations/implications - Since this study was limited to 33 Scottish suppliers, findings can only be used as a guide for further research into the area. The next stage of this research will be to gather more responses from UK and US suppliers of fashion garments, as well as to undertake in-depth interviews with retail buyers in order to explore the criteria they now use for establishing supplier relationships. Practical implications - The paper identifies advantages which manufacturing management could achieve: namely to improve planning, reduce stockholdings, increase production and by improved communication become a preferred supplier. Originality/value - In order to survive, Scottish suppliers have to sustain competitive advantage by ensuring that they have an efficient stock management system. For manufacturers of fashion goods, speed is a priority that incurs higher production and transportation costs that can be offset against fewer mark-downs and higher gross margins. Thus, QRI is a must for multiple fashion retailers selling ""own brand"" merchandise, to provide them with competitive differentiation in the high fashion end of the market. This means that suppliers need to build relationships with these retailers and implement QR systems to stay in business. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Quick response manufacturing; Scotland; Suppliers; Supply chain management; Textiles,2-s2.0-33646752111

The case being discussed pertains to the apparel industry in the USA. The beginning of 2005 marked the end of a 30-year old quota on the apparel market in the USA. This has led many western apparel manufacturers to outsource their production to low-labor cost countries. This in-turn has led to increased customer lead-times. This paper aims to discuss how the implementation of proper IT systems and supply chain measures can reduce lead-times and also reduce total cost. Design/methodology/approach - An integrated approach is utilized to model the impact of apparel outsourcing added to a US apparel producer supply chain by studying the process map, data analysis, and simulation of the supply chain using Visio, Excel and ±Risk simulation software. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the hypotheses on responsiveness and relative costs were tested with and without the outsourcing feature in the US apparel producer supply chain. Findings - The cost savings through outsourcing in the low-cost labor countries in Asia for the US apparel producer supply chain can be huge and the lead-time is quite substantial. Thus, outsourcing is not a viable solution for meeting short-term market demands. However, for large seasonal orders, outsourcing could be an enormous cost-saver. The lead-time of the US apparel producer supply chain could be improved if certain controllable factors such as order processing could be made more efficient. Practical implications - Recent studies by Acaccia, Conte, Maina and Michelini as well as the Leadership for European Apparel Production From Research along Original Guidelines (LEAPFROG, www.leapfrog-eu.org/), were reviewed. However, no recent study that uses Monte Carlo simulation to measure the supply chain in the apparel market for the USA was traceable in the existing literature except one done by Naylor, Burdick and Sasser at Duke University in 1967. The process modeling of the US apparel producer supply chain with the outsourcing feature will be a useful decision analysis tool. With more data and better understanding of the industry, this simulation model can be easily expanded to obtain a more in depth understanding of any US apparel producer supply chain with an outsourcing capability. Even with making some realistic assumptions in the model, one can easily see the potential benefits of outsourcing. The study found that the customer lead-time was averaging around 57 days at three-fourths of the original cost with the minimum customer lead-time being 41 days. Improved IT and logistics capabilities can minimize the variability recognized in major components of customer lead-time, such as ocean freight transportation time, order processing time and manufacturing time. Originality/value - The contribution of the research results from the apparel industry application, where simulation studies of this kind have recently not been executed for a US apparel manufacturer. It also showcases an innovative approach in analyzing outsourcing strategies for a US apparel producer supply chain. The study makes a business case that process improvement can be effectively accomplished with an integrated approach of using widely available inexpensive and user-friendly computer-based tools. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Decision making; Outsourcing; Process planning; Supply chain management; Textile industry,2-s2.0-37549069318

Collaborative working is considered by many to be essential if design and construction teams are to consider the whole lifecycle of the construction process. Much of the recent work undertaken on collaborative working has focused on the delivery of technological solutions with a focus on web (extranets), CAD (visualisation), and knowledge management technologies. However, it is now recognised that good collaboration does not result from the implementation of information technology solutions alone, the organisational and people issues, which are not readily solved by pure technical systems, need also to be resolved. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – Work discussed in this paper brings together the benefits provided by technology, with organisational issues, and people issues, in developing a framework to implement effective collaboration. The research uses a literature search, semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire to gain the industry's requirements for effective collaboration in the construction sector. From these requirements a develop-test-refine approach was taken to develop the methodology for effective collaborative working for construction. Findings – The findings reported in this paper are a summary of the results from the semi-structured interviews and questionnaire used to gain the industry's requirements. They show that a focus on the “softer” issues (business process and an organisations' people) rather than a technology focus is needed to plan and implement collaborative working more effectively in projects. An initial approach is discussed in this paper concerning a structured approach to be developed further in the research to highlight to the industry the issues associated with the planning and implementation of effective collaborative working in projects. Originality/value – This paper uses a socio-technical approach to the planning and implementation of effective collaborative working in construction. It combines technology with the people and business aspects of collaborative working to provide an approach which can enable stakeholders in a project to benefit fully from having a collaborative working approach to their projects. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Construction operations; Decision making; Project planning,2-s2.0-84986146087

More recently, reports of the failure of information systems and technology (IS&T) projects have become more regular and the reported failures more spectacular. This has added to a growing perception that IS&T implementation approaches currently utilised are struggling to add value to customers and users, leading to calls for a re-think of how IS&T is introduced into organisations. This paper seeks to develop a customer experience strategy which will give a key group of stakeholders, customers, a major input in the IS&T development process. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken to examine IS&T implementation at this stage of the development of this theme is empirical. The failed introduction of a new IS&T system in a major service organisation in the UK is used as a case study. Data were gathered from 22 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders in the IS&T project. Findings - The paper finds that the failure was driven by a number of factors, including poor project management and a lack of understanding of how systems can negatively affect organisations and customer relationships. The paper re-emphasises the need to ensure that customer and user perceptions are taken into consideration during any major systems introduction project. An interesting aspect of these systems is that a version is being used today by the organisation. Research limitations/implications - The customer experience journey (CEJ) framework will be improved by being validated within another organisation. Practical implications - The paper recognises that, in the future, a clear framework to support the CEJ needs to be well thought out before a major systems introduction project commences. This is increasingly important as many roll-outs are trans-national and involve customers and supply chains. Originality/value - The paper contributes to work practice relating to customer-driven IS&T service introduction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communication technologies; Customer orientation; Project management,2-s2.0-40749116914

It presents an overview of supply chain management (including BTO-centric approaches) and performance management and then focuses on a case study in which an aerospace components company was attempting to become a BTO enterprise. Thenceforth, the paper analyses key business drivers of using performance management systems (PeMS), and how supply chain-oriented organizations can best leverage IT and PeMS solutions in this regard. Findings - The case study has highlighted the need for the evaluation of PeMS implementation solutions regardless of their typology; wholly vendor-based, best of breed or combination of vendor solution and in-house development, but also an internal audit of processes and existing IS that would aid the implementation of such a concept. Furthermore, the intra- and inter-company political/social/commercial tensions (e.g. relating to anxieties about measuring and highlighting relative business performance) need to be recognized, acknowledged in an open/honest manner and addressed in order that such tensions do not outweigh the concept justifiers which drive systems improvements.

Design/methodology/approach - The proposed modeling framework has used the de facto object-oriented modeling standard, Unified Modeling Language (UML), for building a supply chain model. To compensate for the potential weakness of the pure object-oriented model and UML, the framework integrates business rules with its model. Findings - This paper provides information about several sources, which are the bases of modeling a supply chain. The paper regards a supply chain as five view models with four business domains and each domain consists of functions, resources, processes, interactions and business rules. Research limitations/implications - A typical manufacturing supply chain is considered as a target system to apply this design methodology. The paper does not handle a real case study as an application example. Originality/value - This paper newly added the category of ""Business Process Reengineering (BPR)-driven"" models to the traditional taxonomy of supply chain models and proposed an object-oriented business model (OOBM) for a supply chain as one of the BPR-driven models. It is hoped that this modeling approach is highly usable and adds value to an analyst, practitioner, and designer in the field of supply chain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Flexibility; Object-oriented methods; Supply chain management; Uncertainty management,2-s2.0-24044500315

While recognizing that there are many non-technological facets to KM research and practice, it takes issue with the perspective proposed by some that knowledge management has little or nothing to do with technology. Similarly, the perspective that equates knowledge management with information management is challenged. Design/methodology/approach - The research method involves an analysis of the contrasting perspectives to show that each has blind spots that obscure a clear vision of the relationship between computer-based technology and knowledge management. Building on the ideas of Newell, van Lohuizen, and others, the research advances an alternative perspective to overcome limitations in the other two. Findings - The KM perspective introduced here neither dismisses technology nor identifies with it. From this perspective, this paper develops the contention that modern KM has been tremendously enriched by advances in computer-based technology (CBT), discussing several specific examples. Moreover, this paper concludes that CBT needs to be grounded in a clear, deep consideration of knowledge management. Research limitations/implications - As this is a relatively new perspective, the full extent of its utility will unfold over time as it is adopted, used, and extended. KM researchers can adopt this perspective to guide the conception and design their research projects. Moreover, several implications for business computing systems researchers are outlined. Practical implications - The new perspective offers students and practitioners a middle-ground between two extremes for framing their understanding and observation of KM and CBT phenomena. Originality/value - Both research and practice are shaped by the conceptions that underlie them. The paper furnishes a fresh, inclusive conception of the relationship between KM and CBT.",Computers; Decision support systems; Electronic commerce; Knowledge management,2-s2.0-19944424797

Design/methodology/approach - The proposed planning stage of a CSCM framework incorporates issues of organisation profile, internal functional strategy and supplier-customer strategy. The gauging absence of prerequisites (GAP) analysis technique which embedded in the knowledge-based system is proposed in the planning stage to analyse the gap between the current and the desirable position (benchmark) for an effective implementation in organisation. Findings - The planning stage framework provides information specifically for designing a CSCM by focusing on the organisation capability and business processes and discussed the important issues in planning a CSCM for business organisations, specifically for a manufacturing environment. Research limitations/implications - Further research could be carried out to capitalise the framework for improving the CSCM. Practical implications - The proposed planning stage of a CSCM framework enables the chain members to identify key factors or issues for CSCM development. Originality/value - The new aspects of the proposed CSCM are firstly, the proposed planning stage model is supported by a KBS approach. Secondly, the use of GAP analysis technique and finally, the planning stage framework provides information and issues for the design stage of CSCM framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Channel relationships; Gap analysis; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-33744786526

Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model was proposed and tested using 307 completed interview cases selected from a database of 2,075 Chinese international trading companies published by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce for this study. Findings - The results indicated that network externalities significantly influenced e-business adoption and information asymmetry, and e-business adoption influenced information asymmetry through information sharing and collection. A split sample analysis showed that cultural contexts significantly moderated the interrelationships among network externalities, e-business adoption, and information asymmetry. Research limitations/implications - Data for this study were collected only from mainland China, therefore, non-Chinese companies (foreign-owned) operating in China may have been influenced by Chinese cultures and some of them have been localizing their operations in China. The influences of network externalities on business performance and decision making remain unclear. In addition, data were collected from self-reported questionnaires, and thus may be subject to self-reporting bias. Future studies should use more objective measurements to reduce the potential for self-reporting bias.

Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology and the analysis motivated an interpretive approach. The inductive reasoning approach has been used, since the aim was to find something new for the printing industry and to try to discover the advantages that ERP could bring about for the industry. In this research study, semi-structured interviews were conducted along with a number of visits to the targeted printing firms selected as being prototypical of the sector in this business environment. The research questions focused on identifying and exploring the benefits related to ERP for the printing industry, and why it was needed. Findings - The research shows that all the functional categories identified in the literature for ERP can be introduced in the printing industry. However, within each category, not all its modules can be adopted for this industry. The research has also shown that the benefits of some areas of ERP are still to be understood by the stakeholders. Practical implications - The enterprises under study now have an opportunity to look into ERP solutions as the basis also for first-mover advantage within their sector. Originality/value - There has been one previous attempt in Pakistan to restructure the largest printing press by introducing SAP, which failed due to lack of technical expertise and training support. This paper draws on the successful approaches deployed in ERP implementations in other sectors and examines the extent to which they can be adapted for the printing industry, for example which modules should be prioritised for integration and how to optimise their impact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Management information systems; Manufacturing resource planning; Pakistan; Printing industry,2-s2.0-39449116958

As the information technology (IT) organization looks forward to additional compliance or other IT control frameworks such as COBIT, the paper can help construct a roadmap. Other audiences include senior management, accountants, internal auditors, and academics who may wish to evaluate the impact of SOX on the information technology organization. Design/methodology/approach - SOX is surveyed to understand the four major compliance areas that must be supported in the IT organization. Recently published works are integrated into an evaluation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) research to identity several ongoing themes that point to practical advice for implementing SOX. The private sector of US business is saturated with ERP applications and provides a useful benchmark of what to expect with SOX compliance. The sections of this report include: SOX and IT governance; ERP systems: Recurring themes; after the initial implementation of SOX; frameworks to support SOX compliance; IT governance and SOX: Where we go from here; to best practice and competitive advantage; and conclusion. Findings - Competencies in several related core disciplines including project management, change management, and software integration should be the top priority for SOX implementation. Enterprise architecting and related areas such as security and outsourcing can be managed more effectively with the appropriate competencies.

The current paper is centered on the assumption that I-voting is the next logical step in applying online information-gathering and retrieval technologies to the field of e-government. Design/methodology/approach - A review of the applied literature on electronically enhanced voting methods with potentials associated with internet voting, as well as from practical experience, resulted in a basic model for discussion of the emergent nature of I-voting. Findings - I-voting would reduce the cost for staffing polling stations, and also the funds needed to pay for voting machines. I-voting could also reduce the number of errors made by both the voters and the electoral administrators, and allow for easier adoption of uniform standards in the ballot format, since it could be transmitted via the internet from a central election agency to all local and regional polling places. Bridging the digital divide and internet security issues may be the most important barriers that must be overcome if I-voting becomes a viable option in the USA. Research limitations/implications - It may be years, if ever, before a truly secure, relatively risk-free internet service, such as I-voting, is developed. However, despite the controversies associated with election fraud, the numerous current voting systems that are in place suffer from the same problems associated with online informational exchanges; but, for the most part, nations still conduct their businesses and the political systems are still relatively stable. Practical implications - Owing to recent voting débcles in the USA, the public is demanding a more reliable and secure method of voting. Currently, many nations are moving more toward electronically enhanced voting methods with the long-term goal being internet voting. Unfortunately, there are heated debates about the pros and cons of handing over the right to vote, using a system that is prone to security risks from outside sources. Originality/value - In the short term, there should be increased interest in establishing national and international standards for testing and certification of electronic and I-voting systems and their IT-infrastructure. It is a basic premise of the present study that voting online increases voter participation, which can only be viewed in a positive light. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Data security; Elections; Electoral systems; Internet; United States of America,2-s2.0-26444508449

For any large-scale implementation project, specific business process and system information is included in the enterprise-solution architecture. To understand the totality of any organization's business processes, managers must define and document all core and support processes. Design/methodology/approach The examples used in this paper are from large public sector organizations, but the underlying methodology and conceptual basis for the paper apply to any complex organization. Findings The main conclusion of this paper is that end-to-end (E2E) business process scenarios must be used for defining the requirements for any system implementation project in any organization. If the new system does not align with the E2E-business processes, then management requirements cannot be realized. We also note that E2E scenarios must be considered when implementing enterprise software in a non-enterprise environment. Originality/value The paper notes that E2E scenarios represent the requirements definition level for composite applications enabled in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Traditional implementation methodologies that enable standard software modules (or integration scenarios across modules) are not effective in non-enterprise environments. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Business enterprise; Control systems; Process management,2-s2.0-34250857059

The aims of the study are to provide a technical review of the ABP application and to explore roles of the ABP system in achieving a “fairer” internal resource allocation and an improved understanding of business processes. Design/methodology/approach The CPS's experience of adopting an ABP system is explained through the use of a case study involving interviews, observations, work shadowing and archival data over a period of six years, 2000-2005. The longitudinal nature of the study has enabled the researchers to align the outcome of ABP adoption with concurrent organisational changes. Findings The study reveals that the growing understanding of the intrinsic links between business processes and the ABP information and its rationale, which remains unchanged throughout various phases of organisational changes, has promoted a sense of stability amongst CPS staff members.

Design/methodology/approach The historical roots and the traditional terms used to describe SCM are explored to show how their meanings have led to specific types of information systems to support SCM. The limitations of these systems are demonstrated with case studies. Then the concept of value network advocacy is introduced to address these limitations, and implications of this term are explored. Findings The term SCM has its historical roots in the control of fulfillment activities that support the linear physical flow of goods from suppliers to manufacturers to distributors to retailers. Consequently many information systems (IS) applications that support the supply chain have a similar focus. These systems often separate supply from demand management and focus on linear information flows. Often they are implemented without reengineering business processes. A broader concept, value network advocacy, better describes the needs of business today. It is suggested that adoption of this concept in organizations will be limited not by technology, but by lack of trust mechanisms and metrics. Practical implications The adoption of the broader concept of value network advocacy will enable companies to focus more on developing adaptive networks that support customer needs.

However, the interface of the two topic areas has not received adequate attention from both researchers and practitioners. This paper aims to examine the impact of B2B e-hubs on supply chain integration, with particular emphasis on information integration, B2B e-hub architecture, and enabling technologies. Design/methodology/approach: General system theory (GST) provides the theoretical framework. The main approach is theoretical analysis of information integration and development of e-hub architecture. The paper discusses how information integration can be achieved through B2B e-hubs and explores extensible markup language e-hub architecture and technologies. Findings: GST could provide the theoretical framework of integration, whereas information integration is the foundation of broader supply chain integration. E-hubs open up communication and enlarge networking opportunities and thus tremendously affect information integration. By analyzing B2B e-hubs, this paper explores the mechanism of information integration and points out managerial and technical limitations. Although there are many challenges, e-hubs create value by aggregating and matching buyers and sellers, creating marketplace liquidity, and reducing transaction costs. E-hubs could be a crucial solution to supply chain integration. Originality/value: The paper uses GST as the theoretical foundation to analyze information integration in supply chain operations.

However, because supply chains are scattered across multiple countries and involve many institutions, it becomes an overwhelming practical challenge to ensure transparent recording and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. The myriad issues necessitate a technological solution that will improve supply chain transparency, assist in managing carbon assets and allow all parties to obtain credible information on carbon output. As a potential solution, this study offers a unique architecture that effectively combines “blockchain technology” with the carbon supply chain of a multi-institution business network. Design/methodology/approach: This research and proposed framework are based on publicly available reports on carbon emissions tracking, sustainability, carbon trade and emerging blockchain technologies. The authors also interviewed industry experts to obtain their input and feedback. Findings: Businesses must support the pledges made by their respective governments towards meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Although the emissions trading system encourages businesses to move in this direction, it can be challenging for them to efficiently manage their carbon assets owing to issues such as lack of standardised methods for tracking emissions across suppliers and manufacturers and the fragmentation of carbon markets. The carbon supply chain can maintain a record of the chronological flow of carbon emissions and eventually of all carbon assets by integrating a centralised ledger system based on blockchain technology. Originality/value: Global warming, climate change and carbon emissions are among humanity’s pressing problems today. To achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the 21st century, emissions must be drastically reduced. Global supply chains have a crucial role to play in this context. This article provides a blockchain-based technology framework for carbon emissions visibility and tracking. The authors believe such a platform will provide critical visibility and tracking support to globally dispersed supply chains, moving a step closer towards carbon emissions control and net zero operations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Blockchain technology; Supply chain management; Sustainability,2-s2.0-85146917852

Cyber terrorism is a digital attack on computers, networks or digital information systems, carried out to coerce people or governments to further the social or political objectives of the attacker. Cyber terrorism is costly in terms of impaired operations and damaged assets. Cyber terrorism harms a firm’s reputation, thereby negatively affecting a firm’s stock market valuation. This poses grave worries to company management, financial analysts, creditors and investors. This study aims to evaluate the effect of cyber terrorism on the market value of publicly traded firms. Design/methodology/approach: Financial information was obtained on business firms that were featured in news stories as targets of cyber terrorism. The firm’s stock price was recorded for 1, 3 and 7 days before and after the news article. Percentage changes in the firm’s stock price were compared to percentage changes in the Dow Jones Index to ascertain whether the firm’s stock price went up or down matching the market overall. Findings: Results indicate that stock prices are significantly negatively affected by news of cyber terrorist attacks on companies. In all three time periods after the cyber terrorist attack, there was a significant negative decline in the stock value relative to the Dow Jones Index. Thus, the market valuation of the firm is damaged. As a result, the shareholders and institutions are financially damaged. Furthermore, exposed system vulnerability may lead to loss of business from consumers who have reduced confidence in the firm’s operations. Practical implications: This paper examines the risks posed by cyber terrorism, including its impact on individual business firms, which in turn affect entire national economic systems. This makes clear the high value of cybersecurity in safeguarding computer systems. Taking steps to avoid being a victim of cyber terrorism is an important aspect of cybersecurity. Preventative steps are normally far less costly than rebuilding an information system after a cyber terrorist attack.

Design/methodology/approach: BPC challenges and their success factors were first identified through a literature analysis. Then, the findings from the literature were thematically analysed and qualitatively validated through 35 unstructured interviews for developing the conceptual framework. Findings: The findings from the literature suggested 17 BPC challenge along with their success factors. During the validation process, 15 BPC challenges were accepted by all interviewees, while most of the respondents disagreed with the two challenges of “consolidation of information system re-engineering with BPR”, and “customization”. Moreover, “risk” was suggested as a BPC challenge by several interviewees. Thus, the study offered a modified list of BPC challenges, which was empirically validated.

Just as the linear chain is a simplification of a supply network, the single channel is a simplification of the true complexity many organisations face. When all products are pushed down a single channel, they are paced by the slowest and customers are charged an average price resulting in many being underserved. Manifestly, for most businesses ""one size fits all"" is not a viable option in delivery pipeline design and operation. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Traditionally, the requisite number of delivery pipelines operated by a business is determined by ""hunch"", as is the range of products flowing down each channel to the marketplace. The information technology (IT) revolution, which in turn has spawned the ""analytic corporation"" enables pipeline selection and product matching to be placed on a more formal footing. In order to enable the tailoring of value stream pipelines to markets five classification variables are proposed. These are duration of product life cycle (D), delivery window (W), annual volume (or value) (V1), product variety (V2) and demand variability (V3). Findings: Through the use of case studies drawn from real-world situations, the authors are able to highlight the practical value of using appropriate taxonomies to identify appropriate supply chain design strategies. A framework for the implementation of a scheme for value stream classification is proposed. Practical implications: The proposed analysis, design, and implementation methodology is summarised in flow diagram format. Emphasis is placed on the formation of a ""natural group"" task force to execute this programme. Production, sales, logistics, and marketing are all essential ""players"" therein. Originality/value: It is established that the DWV 3 classification system is suitable for framing pipeline performance improvement programmes. By exploiting the ""analytic corporation"" IT capability, the system has a dynamic role in determination of channel switching as products progress through their individual life cycle phases. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Agile production; Classification schemes; Delivery; Lean production; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-70349210712

Digital twins of customer demands promise to remedy these issues. However, successful implementation necessitates users' technology acceptance. This study contrasts three hierarchical digital twin levels with different degrees of user integration and examines determinants for their respective acceptance. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation model is applied in a comparative manner, considering different levels of digital twin radicalness. A multidimensional approach is used to measure attitudes towards usage. Data are collected in the context of organisational supply management. Findings: Results show harmonious effects across digital twin levels. This indicates that technological radicality plays only a subordinate role when assessing acceptance determinants such as user perception on ease of use, usefulness, trust and risk. Practical implications: Rather than focussing solely on technological factors, findings suggest that users prioritise the actual outcome and efficiency of the system. This perspective offers practical implications for organisations seeking to implement advanced systems and emphasises the significance of user perceptions beyond technological features. Social implications: The societal impact of this research are an appreciation of customer roles in the supply chain where an enhanced detection of customer needs and preferences aligns businesses with the dynamic and evolving demands of a diverse and a continuously environmentally-conscious consumer base.

Measurement of structural, process, and outcome metrics in a reliable, evidence-based, specialty-specific manner maximizes the probability of improving physician performance. The manner in which feedback is provided influences whether the measurement tool will be successful in changing behavior. We created an innovative reporting tool template for anesthesiology practitioners designed to provide detailed, continuous feedback covering many aspects of clinical practice. Methods: The literature regarding quality metric measurement and feedback strategies was examined to design a reporting tool that could provide high quality information and result in improved performance of clinical and academic tasks. A committee of department leaders and information technology professionals was tasked with determining the measurement criteria and infrastructure needed to generate these reports. Data was collected in a systematic, unbiased manner, and reports were populated with information from multiple databases and software systems. Feedback would be based on frequently updated information and allow for analysis of historical performance as well as comparison amongst peers. Results: A template for an anesthesia report card was created. Categories included compliance, credentialing and qualifications, education, clinical and operating room responsibilities, and academic achievements. Physicians were able to choose to be evaluated in some of the categories and had to meet a minimumnumber of criteria within each category. This allowed for customization to each practitioner 's practice. Criteria were derived from the measures of academic and clinical proficiency, as well as quality metrics. Criteria were objective measures and data gathering was often automated. Reports could be generated that were updated daily and provided historical information, and information about peers in the department and within each subspecialty group. Conclusions: We demonstrate the creation of an online anesthesia report card that incorporates metrics most likely to engender positive changes in practice and academic responsibilities. This tool provides timely and customized information for each anesthesia practitioner, designed to be easily modifiable to improve the quantity, quality, and substance of metrics being measured. Finally, our tool could serve as a template for a performance measuring tool that can be customizable to a wide variety of practice settings, and upon which both monetary and non-monetary incentives might be based in the future. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.",Anesthesia; Benchmarking; Outcomes; Performance improvement; Quality; Report card,2-s2.0-84904275682

However, a major impediment for many organizations is understanding where to start in big data and analytics implementation. In many respects, starting a successful implementation is not much different from any other project managed within the organization. The major stumbling block is knowing what questions to ask to get things going. This paper aims to help libraries and information organizations that are considering big data and analytics implementation to begin their journey by following a checklist of eight aspects to be considered in the development of a big data and analytics strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The eight aspects to consider in big data and analytics implementation were developed using a combination of existing project management common knowledge, consultant recommendations and real-life experiences. Findings: Organizations considering big data and analytics implementation need to explore aspects related to the data they have, what organizational problems they are trying to solve, how data governance will work in the new environment, as well as how they will define success in terms of their implementation. These are in addition to the technical issues one would normally expect in a systems implementation. Originality/value: While there have been many articles written about the implementation of big data and analytics in organizations, most of these focus on technical issues rather than managerial and organizational concerns. In addition, none of these other articles have been from the perspective of library and information science. In this article, the focus is specifically on how information professionals may approach this problem. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Analytics; Analytics project implementation; Big data; Big data business concerns; Big data project implementation; Organizational issues related to big data and analytics in the information professions,2-s2.0-85015316761

Also, many of the failures in the implementation of large ITS projects around the world have been attributed to inadequate PM action. This criticism encompasses e-government project initiatives which have attempted ambitious program change, major innovations, large transformations, enterprise wide solutions, collaboration across organisations, governments and private sectors, and the implementation of unprecedented (or ambitious) solutions. The purpose of this paper is to examine these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper forms part of an ongoing research of a PhD degree to describe, critically evaluate and examine the underlying barriers and challenges in large e-government initiatives. Also, this paper examines change in organisations due to the change in the global economy and global information society as new technology is changing the nature of work. It identifies and examines the current and foreseeing problems with large e-government projects and describes how a sociotechnical approach which takes into account, technical, business, citizen, economic needs in the creation of a sociotechnical ITS for future citizens. In addition, the paper offers a technology-enabled enhancement to the project-initiation phase, the area identified as being particularly weak and inadequate in addressing initial requirements of e-government initiatives. Findings: The paper proposes that technology can be incorporated into the professional practice of PM. It can also be a part of a passable solution as opposed to being distinct and separate from it. The PM supporting tools, as opposed to merely reporting actual versus plans have to increase the novelty (art and science) of PM through human interaction, empower the project manager and in aiding his capacity in delivering the expected outcomes. Social implications: The paper demonstrates the value of effective project managers within the wider context of PM in transformational e-government initiatives. It believes that this research will have an impact on three important areas, namely project management practice (PMC), e-government projects and the transformation process of large projects in the public sector. This paper is about changing culture and practice of PMC in handling and managing large projects when different parties involve including outsourcing. This paper investigates and addresses, not only the transformation process of e-government projects, but also, the transformation of PM professional culture (i.e. PMC) that delivers and works. Originality/value: This research paper contributes to the existing literature of PM of large e-government transformational processes. The paper addresses a number of e-government challenges, by critically analysing and summarising a list of e-government challenges and barriers arising from an e-government survey administered on behalf of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance which represents the national technology associations in 70 countries. It compares these challenges to the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK), which is the North American standard in PM methodology. Also, it highlights the weaknesses in PMBOK to address these challenges and offers a technology-enabled enhancement to the project-initiation phase.

This research aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to facilitate the employee selection process through latent semantic analysis (LSA), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and support vector machines (SVM). The research also compares the performance of different machine learning, text vectorization and sampling approaches on the human resource (HR) resume data. Design/methodology/approach: LSA and BERT are used to discover and understand the hidden patterns from a textual resume dataset, and SVM is applied to build the screening model and improve performance. Findings: Based on the results of this study, LSA and BERT are proved useful in retrieving critical topics, and SVM can optimize the prediction model performance with the help of cross-validation and variable selection strategies. Research limitations/implications: The technique and its empirical conclusions provide a practical, theoretical basis and reference for HR research. Practical implications: The novel methods proposed in the study can assist HR practitioners in designing and improving their existing recruitment process. The topic detection techniques used in the study provide HR practitioners insights to identify the skill set of a particular recruiting position. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first study that uses LSA, BERT, SVM and other machine learning models in human resource management and resume classification. Compared with the existing machine learning-based resume screening system, the proposed system can provide more interpretable insights for HR professionals to understand the recommendation results through the topics extracted from the resumes. The findings of this study can also help organizations to find a better and effective approach for resume screening and evaluation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Business process management; Human resources management; Information systems; Recruiting; Text mining,2-s2.0-85145274492

Smart devices are considered as the objects interconnected in the IoT; therefore, they play a fundamental role in the implementation of digital solutions during the execution of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to assess the critical factors for a successful implementation of smart devices in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was performed in the Dominican Republic. This country, located at the heart of the Caribbean, presents an economy that strongly relies on the construction industry. Following a systematic approach, a qualitative data collection and analysis was performed based on semi-structured interviews and content analysis to professionals of construction companies in the Dominican Republic, enquiring the concept of smart devices and critical success factors for implementing the devices in the industry. Findings: The key success factors obtained from the contestants were leadership, technology awareness, company size, usability of proposed solution, cost of implementation and interoperability. Originality/value: This paper provides information to clients of the construction sector regarding the benefits of embedding smart devices into their business activities. Furthermore, this study provides a better understanding of the key factors to be considered by construction organisations when embedding smart devices into their projects. This study also provides recommendations for distinct stakeholders of the construction sector, such as policy makers, clients and technology consultants. Policy makers should especially consider factors such as technology awareness and leadership to develop the right policies for the integration of the IoT in construction projects.

The measurement of e-business (EB) value has been traditionally considered as a single construct. However, the desire to develop a comprehensive understanding of the impact of EB applications from a theoretical perspective has resulted in the modelling of multiple EB constructs. The impact of EB enabled collaboration on operational performance was also investigated. The purpose of this paper is to explore the enabling role of multiple dimensions of EB investigating if all EB applications impact directly and positively on supply chain collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: A web-based survey was carried out to collect data within the German automotive industry. Structural equation modelling was conducted to test the measurement and structural model. Findings: The results provide justification for the modelling of EB in multiple dimensions. Furthermore, some EB applications impacted positively on supply chain collaboration whilst some did not. The results also proved that EB enabled collaboration impacted directly and positively on the multiple dimensions of operational performance tested. Practical implications: EB applications cannot be viewed by practising managers as being universally beneficial in improving collaboration across a buyer-supplier boundary. However, the results reveal that, by carefully selecting the most appropriate EB applications, operations improvement benefits can be realised across a range of operational metrics due to enhanced supply chain collaboration. Originality/value: The deconstruction of EB into multiple constructs will enable the measurement of EB value to be more accurately assessed. Furthermore, the direct impact of EB-enabled collaboration to facilitate interaction and integration and its impact on operational performance adds to the body of knowledge within the larger research field of supply chain collaboration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Collaboration; E-business technologies; E-business value; Germany; Innovation; Operational performance; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-84871999280

First, numerous reliability and validity issues that this practice is plagued by are discussed. Second, recommendations on addressing some of these reliability and validity issues are also proposed. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that draws on literature utilizing IT managerial control ratios to discuss various reliability problems associated with these measures and also makes use of IT strategy theory to challenge the validity of common interpretations of IT managerial control ratios. Findings: This study explains that IT managerial control ratios are subject to numerous reliability and validity issues. The reliability issues arise from the inherent volatility of some of the variables used in these ratios and difficulties that executives have in providing a reliable estimate of those variables when they are approached by market research firms. The validity issues arise from the fact that high and low values of these ratios are subject to different and, at times, somewhat orthogonal theoretical interpretations. Practical implications: IT managerial control ratios are often at the heart of important capital allocation decisions as well as studies which form important stakeholders’ perceptions regarding the business value of IT. These important uses of IT managerial control ratios should not be carried out without understanding the reliability and validity issues discussed in this paper. Originality/value: While IT managerial control ratios are used extensively in benchmarking and research, very few researchers and practitioners possess a full understanding of the reliability and validity issues associated with these measures. This can potentially lead to sub-optimal capital allocation decisions and erroneous findings in studies.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were gathered and structural equation modeling technique is used to test hypotheses. Findings: The empirical test clearly demonstrates the important role that IS architecture planning plays in enhancing IS outsourcing's impact on IS performance. In other words, it shows that IS architecture planning provides a blueprint for establishing necessary technical and administrative platforms, based on which IS outsourcing can be effectively implemented to positively impact IS performance. Consequently, the key proposition in the conceptual model of the study has been empirically validated. Research limitations/implications: The relatively low response rate requires future studies to re-validate the model to test the robustness of the findings. The fact that 75 percent of respondents are IS managers/directors may produce inflated responses on IS performance and future studies with more balanced IS and business managers' participation can help to further verify the model. Future research can also investigate how web compliant-based technologies such as SOA and XML can enable high levels of modularity to improve IS outsourcing effectiveness for better IS performance. As to control variables, the extent of IS outsourcing and the level of IS architecture maturity may be incorporated in a refined model to better test the role IS architecture planning plays in enhancing IS outsourcing's impact on IS performance. IS outsourcing effectiveness may be added to the model as a bridge linking IS outsourcing competences to IS performance. A longitudinal study can be conducted to analyze the dynamics of how IS architecture planning can impact IS outsourcing informed buying and help one to understand the portfolio of outsourcing control mechanisms in a multiple outsourcing projects setting. Practical implications: The empirical support of the key proposition that IS architecture planning enhances IS outsourcing's impact on IS performance makes it very clear that IS management should make due efforts to improve their understandings of various IS components, associated business processes, and their interactive relationships for better IS outsourcing management. Further, the identification of the antecedents of IS architecture planning will enlighten practitioners about how to improve their IS architecture planning competence.

The UK car crash repair sector was used as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The value-chain governance framework proposed by Gereffi et al. was used to assess changes in governance systems as firms developed a reverse logistics flow and three transactional variables were used to determine how supply chains are governed and change. Both forward and reverse product flows for two supply chains were assessed to determine what changes in governance of the supply chain took place as reverse logistics operations developed. Findings: The authors' analysis documents how relationships between the focal firm and other supply chain members altered as the new reverse logistic system developed. The modular governance structure that developed through increased supplier capability coupled with higher levels of knowledge and information codifications were shown to be important factors in the establishment of a reverse logistics system. Supplier capability, knowledge codification and transaction complexity were found to be moderating variables which can enrich the traditional models on buyer-supplier relationships based on trust and ongoing commitment. Practical implications: Reverse logistics continues to be a major issue for business. Our findings provide an insight into some of the governance and knowledge management developments as focal firms respond to growing pressures to re-use materials and parts. In total, six factors were identified which can assist firms in assessing their current governance structures and the development of a pathway for implementation of reverse logistics.

Design/methodology/approach: Given little was known empirically about the strategies and practices which contribute to improved performance, innovation and continuous improvement in the oil and gas sector qualitative method was used. Semi-structured interviews were used to derive senior managers’ constructs of project delivery efficiency and KM based systems. The interviews were analysed through the use of a qualitative analysis software package NUDIST NVivoTM. Participants were selected using purposive sampling. Validity and reliability were achieved by first assessing the plausibility in terms of already existing knowledge on some of the operational issues raised by participants. Findings: These were synthesised into a framework capturing seven well-defined stages. All these steps emerged as being related; they are comprised of independent variables. These steps were found to comprise of knowledge management technology approaches, knowledge management people approaches, KM strategies and value enhancing practices. Research limitations/implications: Although the findings are pertinent to oil and gas organisations, it will be important to conduct follow-up research validating the potential for using the results of this study to establish frameworks for knowledge and information management in different organisations and contexts. This will provide not only data about the validity of the framework in generic terms but will also generate additional data on the application of KM strategy. Practical implications: As shown in this study, successful KM based systems requires the aligning of business strategy, technology for KM, project management operations with an enterprise knowledge-sharing culture. Such sharing requires managing the behaviour of project personnel such that knowledge transfer becomes part of the organisation’s norm. Social implications: The implementation of KM based systems requires deliberate planning and action to create the conditions for success and put in place the strategy, leadership, goals, process, skills, systems, issue resolution, and structure to direct and exploit the dynamic nature of project work. The strategies proposed in this research cannot be expected to resolve all KM issues in the oil and gas sector. However, their use defines an approach that is superior to the traditional approaches typically adopted and consequently merits far wider application. Originality/value: The proposed framework presents a better way of optimising the performance of project-based operations thus enabling oil and gas organisations to reform their poor performance on projects and empower them to better manage emerging cultural challenges in their future projects. Reflecting on their experiences, the participants confirmed that the proposed KM framework and its seven well-defined stages were central to the effectiveness of KM in oil and gas operations. Although the scope of this research was restricted to projects in Nigeria and the UK, the geographical focus of this research does not invalidate these results with respect to other countries. The fact is that the oil and gas sector globally shares some common fundamental characteristics. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cross-cultural issues; Decision making; Developing countries; IT project management; Knowledge adoption; Knowledge integration; Knowledge management systems,2-s2.0-85044615786

Design/methodology/approach: A conventional statistical model (logistic regression) and two machine learning-based (i.e. artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines) data mining models were employed by also using five-fold cross-validation in the classification phase. In order to overcome the data imbalance problem, random undersampling technique was utilized. After constructing the patient-specific risk score, k-means clustering algorithm was employed to group these patients into risk groups. Findings: Results showed that the ANN model achieved the best results with an area under the curve score of 0.867, while the sensitivity and specificity were 0.715 and 0.892, respectively. Also, the construction of patient-specific risk scores offer useful insights to the medical experts, by helping them find a trade-off between risks, costs and resources. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by constructing a framework that can be utilized to determine the risk level of the targeted patient, by employing data mining-based predictive approach. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business analytics; Clustering; Data mining; Decision support systems; Healthcare management,2-s2.0-85053029179

The findings of this study are increasingly important because of the proliferation of social media news stories and the exposure of organizational stakeholders and business decision makers to a tremendous amount of information, including information that is not correct (a.k.a. disinformation). Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected utilizing the snowball sampling methodology. Students in an Management Information Systems course completed the survey. Since a diverse sample was sought, survey participants were instructed to recruit another individual from a different generation. The survey questions of the FFM identify particular personality traits in respondents. Survey respondents were given a collection of nine news stories, five of which were false and four that were true. The number of correctly identified stories was recorded, and the effect of personality traits on the ability of survey respondents to identify fake news was calculated using eta-squared and the effect size index. Findings: Each of the five factors in the FFM demonstrated an effect on an individual’s ability to detect disinformation. In fact, every single variable studied had at least a small effect size index, with one exception: gender, which had basically no effect. Therefore, each variable studied (with the exception of gender) explained a portion of the variability in the number of correctly identified false news stories. Specifically, this quantitative research demonstrates that individuals with the following personality traits are better able to identify disinformation: closed to experience or cautious, introverted, disagreeable or unsympathetic, unconscientious or undirected and emotionally stable. Originality/value: There is scant research on an individual’s ability to detect false news stories, although some research has been conducted on the ability to detect phishing (a type of social engineering attack to obtain funds or personal information from the person being deceived). The results of this study enable corporations to determine which of their customers, investors and other stakeholders are most likely to be deceived by disinformation. With this information, they can better prepare for and combat the impacts of misinformation on their organization, and thereby avoid the negative financial impacts that result. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Disinformation; Five-factor model (FFM) of personality; Social media; Technology disruption,2-s2.0-85077543581

Design/methodology/approach: Incentive rewards motivate knowledge workers to share their knowledge and contribute to a firm’s central knowledge base. The authors develop a model in which the firm’s cultural fit changes with the sequence of KM-based business processes including sharing, learning, evaluation, and production, and then analytically investigate the design of knowledge sharing rewards as well as the business process sequence to shape a firm’s organizational cultural fit and maximize its profit. Findings: The best sequence of KM processes is solved in the following order: (Announcement), (Evaluation), (Sharing), (Learning), and (Production). The sharing reward for knowledge workers is analytically derived accordingly, which increases with the level of KM systems and decreases with the probability of a worker staying in the firm, the probability of a culturally unfit worker being identified by the firm, and the probability of a worker being culturally fit on the labor market. The optimal volume of knowledge base is also investigated with respect to these factors. Originality/value: Applying a novel analytical approach, the authors model and study KM processes and their relationships with organizational culture and incentives.

The foci of this study are strategic management, logistical infrastructure, information technology deployments, and marketing strategies. Findings: The success of Peapod was the result, in general, of application of good strategy and knowledge about the opportunities provided in e-commerce.

Second, provide specific examples of RFID implementation and show how these business applications will add to the effectiveness of the healthcare supply chain. And third, to describe the current state of RFID technology and to give practical information for managers in the healthcare sector to make sound decisions about the possible implementation of RFID technology within their organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Healthcare industry literature was reviewed and examples of specific instances of RFID implementation were examined using an integrated simulation model developed with Excel, @Risk and Visio software tools. Findings: Analysis showed that the cost of implementing current RFID technology is too expensive for broad and sweeping implementation within the healthcare sector at this time. However, several example applications have been identified in which this technology can be effectively leveraged in a cost-effective way. Practical implications: This study shows that RFID technology has come a long way in the recent past and has potential to improve healthcare sector productivity and efficiency. Implementation by large companies such as Wal-mart has helped to make the technology become much more economical in its per unit cost as well as its supporting equipment and training costs. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in the idea that few practical and pragmatic approaches have been taken within the academic field of study for the implementation of RFID into the healthcare supply chain. Much of the research has focused on specific companies or portions of the supply chain and not the entire supply chain. Also, many of the papers have discussed the future of the supply chain that is heavily dependent on advances in RFID technology.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model with four main hypotheses to test the relationships between seven constructs using survey data conducted in the USA. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a structural equation model (SEM) with four constructs defining the activities the user participates in and three constructs defining user satisfaction as a measure of project success. As such, the proposed SEM is the most comprehensive among the models offered in the literature to date, and includes, for the first time, a presentation requirement construct as a specific system requirement for possible user participation. Findings: The authors find that a business user’s participation in functional requirements benefits project outcome, whereas business users should not participate in gathering presentation requirements unless they are experienced middle managers. Research limitations/implications: This study surveyed many industries across the USA and provided a solid statistical base for analysis. Future research should consider exploring IS projects in other countries since various cultures can differ in how they approach to such projects. Additionally, industries are known to have dissimilar needs; therefore, a study exploring specific industries would add to the available research. Practical implications: The authors find that when the general business user participates in certain activities that relate to presentation of the system, his/her involvement negatively impacts the project success. However, if that business user is a middle manager, he/she has a positive impact on the project success. Similarly, when the business user participates in managing the projects, that involvement negatively impacts the project outcome (although the amount of negative impact is relatively small). These results should have an influence on the way the IS project managers allocate business resources to activities, and their decisions regarding whether and where the business users participate. Social implications: The authors expect higher levels of business user satisfaction on IS projects if they are allocated to a limited subset of project activities that has a positive impact on project outcomes. Originality/value: The authors believe these findings contribute to this research domain considerably since they are based on a large sample size on a new comprehensive model of business users that can be generalized across industries. The separation of business requirements into functional and presentation requirements has suggested that there are differing impacts to the project depending on the type of business user involved. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business requirements; Comprehensive; Functional requirements; Presentation requirements; Project management; Project success; User participation,2-s2.0-85045696196

Design and method: The qualitative method uses data from public record interviews, teaching cases, books, Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other archival sources to longitudinally trace the realization of eBay's strategy through its MCS and IT. Findings: Realizing its strategy through the eBay MCS necessitated a diagnostic control system unlike any previously seen. This system created a close-knit online community and enabled buyers and sellers to monitor one another's performance and trustworthiness. Research limitations and implications: The LOCaIT theory facilitated understanding the core aspects of the realization of eBay's strategy through its MCS and IT. However, LOCaIT largely omits the strong linkages evident among elements of the MCS, the importance and necessity of building a core IT infrastructure to support eBay's strategy and the central role of building consumer trust in the realization of this strategy.

In particular, it aims to examine one of the more mature models of ethical value chain governance, Fairtrade, and how this is being used by business. Design/methodology/approach: Information is derived from a longitudinal study of multi-stakeholder co-governance in Kenya and the UK, and an analysis of the literature on similar co-governance models. Findings: The paper shows that mainstream companies are looking to multi-stakeholder models not only to protect their reputation, but as a way of governing ethical dimensions of their value chains. However, rather than a form of co-governance, it has become a way of outsourcing governance, enabling companies to strengthen their public credibility, while simultaneously transferring an especially difficult element of modern value chain governance to organizations enjoying high consumer trust. Yet, primary data suggest that these governance systems are not delivering the benefits promised, at least at the producer level. Practical implications: By outsourcing governance to initiatives with dubious credibility in this way, companies may seem at risk. However, the mismatch between the promise and delivery of Fairtrade does not seem to be affecting consumer confidence and, until it does, companies may continue to benefit from the halo effect of being a Fairtrade ally. But there are also opportunities for companies to use Fairtrade's weaknesses to make the value chain a better avenue for delivering ethical governance, with implications for similar co-governance models. Originality/value: The study draws on one of the very few pieces of longitudinal field research on the impacts of Fairtrade. It approaches Fairtrade from a governance rather than reputations perspective, and emphasizes the implications for mainstream business rather than the co-governance movement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Fair trade; Governance; Social responsibility; Supply chain management; Value chain,2-s2.0-77956134821

Design/methodology/approach: The concept is developed in four stages. First, a definition of a GBO is developed, after reviewing existing definitions and identifying their limitations. The characteristics of GBOs are reviewed, with emphasis on their implications for the management of sustainability programmes. A review of SMS literature and of existing SMS codes and standards has been made, and the limitations of existing SMSs are critically reviewed. Drawing on this three-part analysis, a new model of an SMS suitable for use in GBOs is described. Findings: Existing definitions of global business organizations are inadequate. Existing sustainability management systems standards and codes do not meet the requirements of global businesses (or indeed of other, regional businesses) in several respects. Originality/value: The paper shows that there are special requirements for SMSs in GBOs, and that these are not met by any of the existing models or proposals in the literature. The paper proposes a new model, which combines best-practice from existing literature with new features. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Management information systems; Modelling; Multinational companies; Sustainable development,2-s2.0-77957320726

The Long-Horizon Event Study (LHES) is essential for providing a more appropriate measure of the value of IT investments because firms' strategic decisions often set long-horizon and large-scale organizational goals, and there is inherent uncertainty regarding future cash flows resulting from these investments. Therefore, the authors aim to analyze how announcements of IT investments affect the firm's abnormal stock returns over the long term and to compare the differential impact of different features of IT investment. Design/methodology/approach: The authors gathered IT investment announcements and stock data of listed firms in Korea between 2000 and 2018, and the monthly stock market returns over the 5 years after the announcements. To measure the differential impact of IT investments based on the investment features, the authors separate announcements data into five groups. A LHES is used to estimate the long-term effects of IT investment announcements. Findings: The results indicate that announcements of IT investments had a long-term positive effect on firm performance. Additionally, the findings reveal differential effects of IT investments across industries and investment features. Notably, news of self-developed IT investments and IT investments in the manufacturing industry had significantly positive effects. However, contrary to common belief, announcements of investments in so-called essential IT areas such as data, security, or new IT infrastructure did not yield significant effects. Originality/value: Although the need for LHES has been emphasized in information systems research, few follow-up studies have been conducted since Barua and Mani (2018). This is primarily due to the challenges associated with collecting large-scale abnormal stock returns data over a long horizon. This research represents the first LHES to investigate the differential impact of IT investments based on their features. By doing so, this study can provide valuable insights for decision-makers within firms, helping them understand the time horizon of market outcomes of IT investments based on their features. Furthermore, this work extends the scope of LHES to comprehend the differential impacts of investment features. For instance, managers need to grasp that so-called essential IT investments, such as data management, security enhancements or new IT infrastructure, may not necessarily generate long-term market value. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Features of IT investments; IT investments; Long-horizon event study; Long-term business value of IT,2-s2.0-85198563159

By examining the role of organizational and environmental contexts, this study contributes to the existing literature by proposing a novel and detailed technology-organization-environment (TOE) model for the complex interplay between firm characteristics and the adoption of data analytics. The results offer valuable insights and practical implications for organizations seeking to leverage data analytics for effective performance management. Design/methodology/approach: The research draws upon a data set encompassing over 21,869 companies operating across all European Union member states. A multilevel logistic regression model was developed to evaluate the influence of organizational and environmental factors on the likelihood of adopting performance analytics in organizations. Findings: The findings indicate that the lack of awareness of the benefits of data analytics and its practical application to address specific business challenges is a significant barrier to its adoption. Organizational contexts, such as variable-pay systems, employee training, hierarchical structures and frequency of monetary rewards, also influence the adoption of data analytics. Research limitations/implications: The study informs managers about the strategic role of data analytics capabilities in performance management for improved business intelligence and driving data culture. Practical implications: The study helps managers understand the strategic role of data analytics capabilities in performance management, leading to improved business intelligence and fostering a data-driven culture in five key areas: structural alignment, strategic decision-making, resource allocation, performance improvement and change management. Originality/value: The study advances the TOE theory, making it a more detailed and complete framework, particularly applicable to the adoption of performance analytics. It identifies the main factors of adoption that play a crucial role in this process. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Analytics; People analytics; Performance analytics; Performance management; TOE framework,2-s2.0-85179347384

Design/methodology/approach: The study deploys a qualitative approach to generate the appropriate decision criteria. The balanced scorecard and Pareto's chart (using Minitab® version 18) were used for gathering and analysing the pertinent criteria. Findings: The process of evaluating and selecting the right manufacturers is essential. Manufacturer (supplier) selection is no longer decided solely based on cost/price criterion; currently, the quality and delivery criteria prevail. Additional incorporated criteria include price/cost, technical capability, production facilities and capacity, customer satisfaction and impression, geographical location, management and organisation, financial position, environmental concern, performance history, repair service, information technology and communication systems, procedural compliance, labour relation record, reputation, flexibility or diversification, attitude, operating controls, business desire, packaging ability, past business records, trust and loyalty, training aids, complaint handling service, warranties and claim policies, reciprocal arrangements, research and development and innovation, modern slavery concern, sustainable capability, collaborative/partnership and responsiveness. The study proposed a conceptual framework of an EE alongside how manufacturers working as a single virtual entity can consider the supply chain operations reference (SCOR®) model. Research limitations/implications: The identified CSDC are suitable for order allocation to domestic manufacturers. The deployed approaches could be extended to the mixed and quantitative approaches for increasing the generalisability. Originality/value: The study establishes the pertinent CSDC that are important to execute equitable order distribution to manufacturers in an EE framework. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Balanced scorecard; Buyer-supplier relationships; Decision-making; Extended enterprise; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Supply chain operations reference model,2-s2.0-85082183758

Design/methodology/approach: The data used to develop the input to the national health service facilities risk exposure system (NHSFRES) was solicited from 60 healthcare managers. Risk exposure system has been developed using the risk knowledge that was articulated from experienced healthcare operators through postal questionnaires and repertory grid interviews. This knowledge was then transformed and represented in Trajan 4.0, an expert system shell that uses artificial neural networks as its modelling technique. Findings: It provides healthcare facilities operators an avenue to evaluate their own risk management method (point score system) based on their own healthcare business knowledge/judgment and corporate objectives for various FM service operations. Research limitations/implications: The key issue that should always be noted by NHSFRES users is that, the concept of measuring or evaluating business risks will always be uncertain. Professional judgment, based on sound information, is an essential element in interpreting and using the system. Practical implications: The model provides healthcare facilities managers a vehicle for predicting pre- and post-facilities risk-factors in healthcare operations before they occur. A clear understanding of the risk signals would mean that appropriate management course of action should to be considered that will improve FM operators' business performance. Originality/value: The NHSFRES is developed using the risk knowledge that was articulated from experienced healthcare operators through postal questionnaires and repertory grid interviews. It provides a reasonable early warning signal to the healthcare managers, and can be used by decision makers to evalute the severity of risks on healthcare facilities business operations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Decision support systems; Facilities; Health and medicine; Neural nets,2-s2.0-33645828018

The purpose of this paper is to advance BI and data analytics technologies as precursors to the design of HR management protocols and database strategies. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the fact that the increasing prevalence of globalization is driven by a number of factors including growing consumers in developing countries, technological progress, and worldwide workforce diversity. HR departments of global companies must implement BI techniques and assemble global databases that obtain information such as employee's attrition and hiring, compensation and benefits, ethnic, gender, cultural, and nationality distributions. By applying advanced analytical techniques on the global database, human resources professionals will acquire intelligent business insight, predict changes and make informed decisions at operational and strategic levels. Findings: The business environment is constantly evolving into a more complex system and with global competition, decision making in organizations has become increasingly intricate and convoluted. This creates challenges for global organizations' HR departments to manage a workforce diverse in cultures, time zones, expertise, benefits and compensations. Practical implications: Only those multinational enterprises willing to adapt their human resource practices to the changing global labor market conditions will be able to attract and retain high performing employees. BI and data analytics can aid in making informed decisions based on knowledge extracted from the data and options at hand. Organizations that have successfully implemented BI are able to make decisions quickly and with more accuracy. They have better and faster access to the key activities and processes that the organizations and its functional departments must pursue to meet their goals and objectives. Originality/value: The paper tackles one of the most critical problems of educating multinational enterprises to adapt their HR practices to the changing global labor market conditions.
